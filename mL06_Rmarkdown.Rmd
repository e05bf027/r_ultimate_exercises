# Word Processing

You can format text in **bold** or *italic*. 

You want to calculate exp(1). If written in plain text, it renders literally
and directly as exp(1). We must put it in a code chunk.

# Code Chunk

```{r}
exp(1)
```

# Plots

```{r}
library(plotly)
data('volcano')
plot_ly(z = volcano, type = 'surface')
```
