# Matrices

Let's create a matrix.

```{r}
vec1 <- 1:24   # data for the matrix
mat1 <- matrix(data = vec1, nrow = 6, ncol = 4, byrow = F)
mat1

```

# Arrays

Now let's create an array! Itr is like a matrix, but where a natrix has 2 dimensions, an array has >2!

```{r}
arr1 <- array(data = vec1, dim = c(3, 4, 2)) # i.e. a cube 3x4x2
arr1
```

We can ask what the dimensions of an array are. But, we can also use this `dim` 
command to reshape the dimensions of an array.

```{r}
dim(arr1)

arr2 <- arr1
dim(arr2) <- c(2, 2, 6)
arr2
```

Let's double check this by checking the dimensions of the arrays.

```{r}
dim(arr1)
dim(arr2)
```
