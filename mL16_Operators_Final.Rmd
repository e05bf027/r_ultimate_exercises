# Arithmetic Operators

```{r}
a <- c(20, 40, 60)
b <- c(100, 3, 5)
``` 

```{r}
# these are all performed step-wise (a1 with b1,a2 with b2, etc)
a+b
a-b
a/b
a*b
```

You can use the exponent function with ^ or **:

```{r}
b**a
b^a
```

For integer division you have 

```{r}
a %% b  # modulus (i.e. gives THE REMAINDER from the division)

a %/% b  # div (i.e. the 'inverse' of modulus - the whole number division)
```

# Logical Operators

There are logical operators, which return a boolean result.

```{r}
a < b
a <= b
a > b
a >= b
a == b
a != b
```

# Special Operators

```{r}
a <- seq(0,10, 2)
b <- seq(0, 10, 3)
a
b

b %in% a
```
