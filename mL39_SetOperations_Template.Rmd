# Introduction

We create two ranges that overlap.

```{r}
a <- 1:10
b <- 5:15
```

# Intersect

*intersect()* calculates the intersection of two vectors.

```{r}
intersect(a, b) # what exists in BOTH a and b
```

# Setdiff

*setdiff()* calculates the difference of two vectors.

```{r}
setdiff(a, b) # what exists in set a but NOT b
setdiff(b, a) # what exists in set b but NOT a
```

# Union

*union()* calculates all unique observations from both vectors.

```{r}
union(a, b) # what are the values in all a AND all b
```
